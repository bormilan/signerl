# SignErl

SignerL is a small Erlang library for signing XML messages. It currently supports
basic signing and verification over normalized XML. The project is early-stage
and evolving, but active.

## Status

Early development. APIs may change and XML-DSig compliance is not complete yet.

## Features

- Sign an XML message using a private key.
- Verify a signature using a public key.

## Quick Start

```erlang
% Sign from a binary message and a loaded key:
{ok, SignedMessage} = case signerl:sign(RawMessage, sha256, PrivateKey) of
    {error, invalid_prolog} -> {error, invalid_prolog};
    SignedXml -> {ok, SignedXml}
end.

% Verify:
true = signerl:verify(SignedMessage, sha256, PublicKey).
```

`sign/3` returns signed XML with:
- `<ds:SignedInfo>` (deterministic internal profile, canonicalization deferred)
- `<ds:SignatureValue>` containing base64 signature bytes over `ds:SignedInfo`
- `<ds:Object>/<xades:QualifyingProperties>/<xades:SignedProperties Id="SignedProperties-1">`
- `<xades:QualifyingProperties Target="#Signature-1">`

`SigningTime` is currently strict UTC in `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ` format.

`verify/3` expects a signed XML message. It returns:
- `true` when signature verification succeeds
- `false` when signature bytes are present but do not match message/key
- `{error, invalid_signature}` when signature structure/properties are missing or malformed

`verify/3` validates `ds:Reference` digest values (document + signed properties) before verifying
`ds:SignatureValue`.

## Development toolchain

The primary development runtime is **Erlang/OTP 28.5.0.7** with
**rebar3 3.25.1**, pinned in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions). GitHub Actions
reads these pins. OTP 26 and 27 remain compatibility targets on Ubuntu and
Windows; their CI jobs track the latest available patch in each major release.

With [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), register any missing plugins once, then install
the repository's versions:

```bash
asdf plugin add erlang https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang.git
asdf plugin add rebar https://github.com/Stratus3D/asdf-rebar.git
asdf install
```

The Erlang plugin builds OTP from source; follow its
[platform prerequisites](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang#before-asdf-install).
Alternatively, install the pinned OTP and rebar3 releases directly. Native
testing also requires OpenSSL for certificates and `xmllint` for canonicalization
comparisons (`libxml2-utils` on Debian/Ubuntu). CI installs the Linux prerequisite.

[rebar3 3.25.1](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/releases/tag/3.25.1) supports the
retained OTP 26–28 matrix and includes Windows fixes for OTP 28. The
[OTP 28.5.0.7 release notes](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-28.5.0.7)
record the selected patch's fixes and compatibility notes.

## Tests

Run tests with rebar3:

```bash
scripts/gen_certs.sh
rebar3 test
```

Run the complete quality gate before pushing:

```bash
rebar3 tall
```

`tall` runs the test alias (formatting, EUnit, Common Test, and a 100% coverage
check), lint, Xref, and Dialyzer. Formatting runs once; `flint` remains available
for standalone formatting and lint checks. Run it natively before pushing.
GitHub Actions runs the same gate on OTP 26/27/28 across Ubuntu and Windows;
all six jobs must pass on the latest PR commit before merging. CI runs for pull
requests and pushes to `dev` and `main`.
Generate the test certificates before the first run.
Each `rebar3 test` run resets collected coverage once, then combines fresh EUnit
and Common Test coverage for the 100% threshold. Focused runs of either framework
are useful during development but do not replace that combined gate. See the
[test responsibility map and focused commands](test/TESTS.md).

## Test Certificates

Generate test-only keys and certificates:

```bash
scripts/gen_certs.sh
```

Docs for the generated artifacts:
`test/certs/README.md`

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Keep changes small and focused, with one PR per issue
targeting `dev`. Follow the validation-first workflow in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md):
investigate, add behavioral validation, implement, test, review and simplify,
then run all tests, coverage, lint, and Dialyzer. Push only after native
`rebar3 tall` passes, and merge only after all six GitHub Actions jobs pass
on the latest PR commit.
